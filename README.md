# Air-Canvas

<h2>Abstract</h2>
With the introduction of new detection technologies, the interaction of air with computers 
has become even more practical. It is true that next-generation technologies will make it 
easier for people to interact with machines. <br>
This project presents a real time video based pointing method which allows sketching 
and writing over air in front of camera. 
Air Canvas provides a platform for users to interact with the computer through hand 
movements, using the camera as a sensor to detect hand movements.
Air canvas helps to draw on a screen just by waiving your finger fitted with a colorful point 
or a simple colored cap. We will be using the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to 
build this project. The preferred language is python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy 
to use syntax. <br>

<h2>One time Setup:</h2>

    pip install mediapipe
    
    
 <h2>To execute:</h2>
